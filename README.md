# About
Full-stack PHP developer with a passion for building robust and scalable web applications. Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, from small business websites to complex enterprise systems, always striving to write clean, maintainable code. Beyond development, I enjoy helping others learn, whether through mentoring, writing tutorials, or answering questions in online communities. Sharing knowledge and seeing others grow as developers is incredibly rewarding.

In addition to PHP, I’ve embraced other languages and tools that spark my curiosity. I’m a Rustacean at heart, drawn to Rust’s performance and safety guarantees, and a Gopher exploring the simplicity and concurrency of Go. As a dedicated Linux user, I appreciate the flexibility and control it offers, both for development and everyday computing. Open-source software and the communities around it have been a big part of my journey, and I love contributing back whenever I can.
